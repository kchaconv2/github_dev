Research Area: Primate evolutionary genomics and cell biology

My research focuses on investigating how gene expression in the brains of primates has evolved in the past and currently contributes to known differences between primate species - specifically, those related to metabolism. I use cell biology, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatic techniques to investigate this. I write blog posts intermittently for TLS about a range of topics.
