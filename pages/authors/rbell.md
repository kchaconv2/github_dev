Research Area: Ecology and evolution of primate hair morphology

I am interested in how primate hair morphology has been shaped by different ecological and evolutionary factors. I am currently conducting research on primate hair microbiome diversity, and hope to connect my ecological and evolutionary research with primate conservation issues. I am also passionate about science outreach and education, and am a member of the TLS Outreach Committee.
