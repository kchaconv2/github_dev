Research Area: Biogeography of invasive plants to understand the patterns of invasion in the context of global change<br>

I fell in love with plant biology when I was in high school and it has stayed with me ever since. I am really interested in understanding the ways plants interact with one another and how global change affects plant ecology. I focus specifically on invasive plants and how our understanding of where they are in time and space can improve our management of these invasions. Iâ€™m also interested in communicating this information in a way that everyone can understand and be just as excited about as I am. I am a writer for the TLS blog and also on the outreach committee so that I can help share the wonderful world of science.
